# Login Debug Instructions

## Current Status
✅ Backend is working - tested and confirmed
✅ Admin user created in database
✅ Debug logging added to both frontend and backend

## Test Credentials
**Email**: `admin@example.com`
**Password**: `admin123`

## How to Debug

1. **Open your frontend application** (should be running on http://localhost:3000)
2. **Open Developer Tools** (Press F12 or right-click → Inspect)
3. **Go to the Console tab**
4. **Attempt to log in** with the credentials above
5. **Look for debug messages** that start with 🔍 DEBUG:

The debug output will show:
- What credentials are being sent
- The API URL being used
- The exact request and response details
- Any errors that occur

## What to Look For

If you see `🔍 DEBUG: Attempting login with formData:` followed by the correct email/password, then the issue is likely:
- Network connectivity
- CORS issues  
- Backend not receiving the request

If you see an error before that, then the issue is in the frontend validation or setup.

## Alternative Users

If the admin credentials don't work, you can also try:
**Email**: `chamithashelan27@icloud.com`
**Password**: (whatever password you set for this account)

## Next Steps

Please share the console output so I can identify exactly what's going wrong.
